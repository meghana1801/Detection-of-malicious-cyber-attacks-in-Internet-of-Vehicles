    Internet of Vehicles has changed the automotive industry by providing advanced technology for safe navigation and traffic management. Modern vehicles, including connected and autonomous ones, use intra-vehicle networks for various functions and are linked to outside networks through vehicle-to-everything(V2X) technologies. In addition to that, the increased functionality and connectivity of these vehicles make them prone to cyber-attacks on both intra-vehicle and external networks. Enhancing the security of vehicular networks is a critical challenge. While previous research has made progress in developing models for detecting cyber-attacks, intrusion detection still remains complex because of the high volume of network traffic data, numerous network characteristics, and various types of cyber-attack patterns. This study proposes a malicious cyber attack detection system using various machine learning algorithms that efficiently identifies known cyber-attacks on both intra-vehicle and external networks. 

    % The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has revolutionized the automotive industry, enabling safe navigation and traffic management through connected and autonomous vehicles. However, the increased connectivity of modern vehicles has also heightened their vulnerability to cyber-attacks on both internal and external networks. Despite previous efforts to develop intrusion detection models, the high volume of network traffic data, numerous available network features, and diverse cyber-attack patterns pose significant challenges. This study proposes a novel multi-tiered hybrid intrusion detection system, leveraging multiple machine learning algorithms to efficiently identify known and zero-day cyber-attacks on both intra-vehicle and external networks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our model, achieving high accuracy on various known datasets.Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model through accuracy comparisons on various established datasets.

    % Internet of Vehicles has transformed the world of automotive industries.This emerging technology assists the users in safe navigation and traffic management.Contemporary vehicles, such as connected and autonomous vehicles, utilize intra-vehicle networks to execute diverse functions and operations. These vehicles are also linked to external networks through vehicle-to-everything technologies, facilitating communication with other vehicles, infrastructures, and smart devices. However,the enhanced functionality and connectivity of modern vehicles heighten their susceptibility to cyber-attacks on both internal and external networks due to the extensive attack surfaces. The challenge here is to enhance the security of vehicular networks.Although many previous works have made some success in developing models to detect cyber-attacks , intrusion detection is still a challenging problem due to the high volume of network traffic data, numerous available network features, and various cyber-attack patterns.In this study, we propose a multi-tiered hybrid intrusion detection system to efficiently identify known and

%     In the realm of contemporary automotive industries, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has emerged as a transformative technology, enhancing safe navigation and traffic management. IoV-enabled vehicles, including connected and autonomous variants, employ intra-vehicle networks for diverse functionalities and operations. Furthermore, these vehicles communicate with external networks via vehicle-to-everything technologies, facilitating interactions with other vehicles, infrastructures, and smart devices. Regrettably, the expanding functionality and connectivity of modern vehicles expose them to increased cyber-attacks on both internal and external networks, owing to extensive attack surfaces.

% To fortify vehicular networks' security, this study introduces a multi-tiered hybrid intrusion detection system, integrating multiple machine learning algorithms to detect both known and zero-day cyber-attacks on both intra-vehicle and external networks. Our proposed system encompasses a multi-stage learning model, consisting of data pre-processing, feature engineering, and four distinct tiers of learning models. These tiers include tree-based supervised learners, stacking ensemble models, cluster labeling unsupervised learners, and biased classifiers. The experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to accurately detect various known attack patterns on the CAN-intrusion-dataset, representing intra-vehicle network data, and the CICIDS2017 dataset, illustrating external vehicular network data. This research emphasizes the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed intrusion detection system in securing IoV networks.
