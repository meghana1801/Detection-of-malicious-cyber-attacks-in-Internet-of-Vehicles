 In this project, we've utilized an ensemble machine learning model to detect intrusions in Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Given the noisy nature of IoV data, we adopted a combination of ReliefF, a filter-based method, and Genetic Algorithm, a wrapper-based method, for feature selection. Our ensemble model comprises Decision Trees , Random Forest, and Extra Trees, which we stacked together. XGBoost serves as the meta-model to provide final predictions.

Looking ahead, our aim is to gather more realistic IoV datasets and evaluate the performance of our model on these datasets. To achieve this, we intend to generate datasets using the Veins simulator, which simulates realistic vehicular traffic scenarios. Testing our model on these more representative datasets will allow us to validate and refine its performance in real-world IoV environments, ensuring its effectiveness in detecting intrusions.
